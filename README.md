Hello everyone! This is my first game that I made. I hope you enjoy it while playing. So, generally my game is a word guessing game. It works like this: The hidden word is based on your last digit of your student ID. So that means that you have ten guesses. BUT, you have only three lives. This makes it difficult. The game is made using HTML code for the website pages, CSS code for the structures and designs of the pages and Java Script for the game itself. This is all I can say about the game so stop reading this and enjoy the game youselves.
